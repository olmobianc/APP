      <p>
        Most popular apps today are essentially reimaginings of the same framework: 
        you swipe through a large pool, connect on shared interests, and then a chat box opens.
      </p>
      <p>
      Their business models rely on maximizing users' screen time, and they’ve perfected 
      the formula—people now swipe, scroll, and message for an average of 38 hours per skill 
      match. If you’re genuinely looking to exchange skills or learn something new, this can 
      make the process frustrating and time-consuming.
      </p>
      <p>
      That’s why we created SkillSwap. With a fresh approach and a fair model, we’re here to 
      revolutionize skill-sharing. We prioritize meaningful, real-world connections—one skill 
      exchange at a time.
      </p>
